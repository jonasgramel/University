Intro assignement to image processing and neural networks.

The files I have been editing are gray_scaling_inverting_convilcing_smoothing.ipynb and MNIST_classification.ipynb. The rest are utilisation files given by the lecturers.
Most of the functions where implemented already, but the main logic was left for us students.
