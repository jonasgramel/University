# ML_AIS_Vessel_Trajectory_Prediction

This project was a Kaggle challenge with the goal of predicting the future position of the vessels in the dataset (latitude, longitude) up to five days forward. The dataset was AIS data from 1st of January to 7th of May 2024.

The data:
- training set: 1522065 entries for 11 columns, such as time, latitude, longitude, portId, coq, sot and rot.
- vessels: 688 vessels with columns such as vessel type, engine power, breadth and depth
- ports: 1330 ports with ID, name, latitude and longitude.
